# Day 01 â€” Methods & Unit/Tests
## Outcomes
Students can construct methods that set or get values, take parameters and return information via a method. Can complete a unit test on a method and understand the value of test driven development (TDD). Learn about style guides & naming method naming conventions.

## On successful completion of this unit students will be able to:
- write a ruby method
- discuss naming conventions
- write unit tests to test methods
- avoid writing a false test
- know about the unit test library
- know of recursion
- difference between statements & expressions
- good functional programming practices


## Guided instructions

### methods
- discuss what methods are useful for
- discuss keyword ```def``` & statements vs expressions
- write a named method 
- explain parameters
- write a method with parameters
- manipulate values of a parameter
- have method return information
- discuss getting and setting
- discuss functional programming
- discuss DRY principle (don't repeat yourself)

### unit-tests
- discuss the importance of TDD
- discuss avoiding false tests

## Challenges
- write on paper a function that converts to base 3, 5

## Resources
- [Naming conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming))

## Useful quotes
> Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.
